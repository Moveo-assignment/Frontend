# frontend
This app allows for mentor to view the student solving code real time.

I used MERN stack to build this app, React, MongoDB, Node, Express, Postman, Socket.io.
I deployed it with netify and render.

The problem that i've had is that the deployed netify and render did not work with the socket communication, 
altough it worked good on local, and when I deployed the client side but used the local server as my server.

here is a quick video about the app (plus i've added the bonus at the end of the video)

if you want to activate it localy you can run npm start at client side and nodemon app.js at server side.
